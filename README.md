# holiday_assessment_files
Repository for my Python Holiday App assessment.

Main file right now is "function_progress", where I'm adding code as it seemingly works. It's not entirely finalized, but it is the most up to date version of the program.

"holiday_startercode" is the beginning file used to import and populate the innerHolidays list in the program. 

"holidays" is the file that the json writer function writes the innerHolidays list to when called. I currently have  .txt as well as a .json version being made.

"holiday_startercode_unaltered" is the pseudocode used to plan out the program. 

The remainder of the files are mostly just scratchpads I've been using to test out various functions.
