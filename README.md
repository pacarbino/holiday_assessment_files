# holiday_assessment_files
Repository for my Python Holiday App assessment.

The final program is in the 'holiday_program_final' file.

Main file right now is "function_progress", where I'm adding code as it seemingly works. It's not entirely finalized, but it is the most up to date version of the program.

"holidays.txt" is the beginning file used to import and populate the innerHolidays list in the program. 

"mainHolidayList" is the json file that the web scraper function writes the innerHolidays list to when called.

"holiday_startercode_unaltered" is the pseudocode used to plan out the program. 

The remainder of the files are mostly just scratchpads I've been using to test out various functions.
